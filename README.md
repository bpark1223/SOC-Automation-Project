<h2>Description</h2>
In this cybersecurity project, I created a comprehensive  diagram of data traversing through a network. More specifically, I visualized how data traverses through different tools such as TheHive and Wazuh Managers to ensure effective monitoring of an IT environment, detecting threats, managing incidents, and ensuring compliance with security policies and regulations.
